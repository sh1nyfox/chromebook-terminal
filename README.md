My personal Chromebook terminal setup, feel free to use for your own machine.

Background color - #282A36 (Dracula background)
Cursor color - #FF79C6 (Dracula pink)

Prompt - [Synth Shell](https://github.com/andresgongora/synth-shell)

I'm just using the standard bash shell with Neofetch autoloading. Neofetch config is nothing fancy but can be found in this repo also.

Any future updates will be pushed to this repo.
